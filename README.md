# Hidropodex

## Descriptions
Hydropodex is an iOS application that is integrated with IoT to monitor hydroponic plant plantings which in real time will send data in the form of humidity, flowing water and temperature from the hydroponic system using the Antares platform from Telkom Indonesia. 
This application is also equipped with an object detection feature using CoreML with a model created using CreateML with a dataset from Kaggle. This object detection is able to detect the type of disease in hydroponic plants in real time. Currently the model made only supports tomatoes.
